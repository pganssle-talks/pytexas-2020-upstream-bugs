Notes:

I have to start with a disclaimer here. This talk is organized as a series of strategic retreats from doing the "right thing". By some measures, each strategy may be considered worse than the last one, and it is for each person to decide for themselves what hill to die on.

We will of course start with the right tool for the job, but we'll get increasingly hacky and dangerous as we move on.
