Notes:

Patience is a virtue. Each of these strategies involves incurring some technical debt, and some of them involve _imposing_ technical debt on your entire organization. Consider developing strategies to allow you to patiently wait for upstream fixes to deploy.

In for a penny, in for a _penny_ â€” don't let these hacks grow beyond what's absolutely justified. These largely represent technical debt, so don't accrue too much of it, and pay it down as quickly as you can.
